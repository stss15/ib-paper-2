Option D — Object-oriented programming
15.

(a)

Award up to [4 max].
Award [1] for an advantage and [1] for an elaboration for up to two advantages.
Re-use objects/modules across sub-groups;
Which will speed up development;
Work can be split up across the sub-groups;
Which will speed up development;
Sub-groups can re-use objects;
Without having to re-program;
Quicker to test;
As each module is small/independent;

(b)

[4]

Award up to [4 max].
Award [1] for an issue and [1] for an explanation stating its importance, for two
issues, up to [4 max].
Testing;
Of system is extremely important to see that loans, fines, borrowing and rights
work correctly;
(Any one of the reasons on the list, not all required)
Acknowledgement of code sources;
Important to avoid any potential legal issues;
Accept other reasonable explanations that clearly refer to ethical aspects for the
work of the programmers.
[4]

(d)

(e)

(f)

Award up to [3 max].
By using private for variables for example studentID;
Data can be protected from accidental changes;
From outside the object;

[3]

Award up to [2 max].
Student newStudent = new Student(93003, "Smith")
Award [1] for Student newStudent
Award [1] for new Student(93003, "Smith").

[2]

Award up to [3 max].
Static means that the variable is declared once only;
Static variable is a class variable not re-declared in each object;
And not each time an object is created;
The variable represents the number of times a Loan object is created;
And hence is a total of how many books have been borrowed;

[3]

Award up to [3 max].
ST.addLoan (new Loan(212000, "The Stars"))
Award [1] for ST.addLoan.
Award [1] for new.
Award [1] for Loan (212000, "The Stars").

Award up to [7 max].
Award [1] for correct signature (do not accept non-void/return methods.
StudentID must be passed as a parameter).
Award [1] for correct identification of student s.
Award [1] for printing student’s name.
Award [1] for correct loop with limit of i<10 or equivalent expressions.
Award [1] for correct identification of current loan.
Award [1] for test on loan.
Award [1] for printout of both Title and Date of the current loaned book.
For example:
public void showDetails (int StudentID )
{
Student s = borrowers[StudentID];
System.out. println(s. getStudentName());
for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
{
Loan currentLoan = s.getLoan(i);
if (currentLoan != null)
{
System.out.println(currentLoan.getBookTitle();
System.out.println(currentLoan.getDate();
}
}
}
[7]
Note: Award [1] for both final System.out.println statements. Marks are not
awarded if methods are used that are not defined or already present in the
specification.

(c)

Award up to [3 max].
There is no way to determine the fines;
There is no way to differentiate between the short term and long term loan books;
There is no way to indicate if a student’s borrowing rights are suspended;
Nothing to prevent error or check number of books borrowed
[3]

(d)

Award up to [2 max] for any acceptable description.
For example:
Add a Boolean variable to represent the borrowing rights;
Initially set this variable to true;
The variable is set to true unless rights are suspended when it is set to false;
etc;

(a)

Award up to [2 max].
Inheritance reduces the amount of coding / reduces repetition of code;
By allowing sub-classes to inherit the methods / attributes of their superclass; [2]

(b)

Award up to [2 max].
Variable for the fine (per day);
Variable for the borrowing limit;
Variable timeLimit;

(c)

[2]

A suitable diagram will look like this.

Award [1] for all four correct classes as shown.
Award [1] for showing the links in the correct place (any arrow or line).
Award [2] for distinguishing either with labels (Student has a Loan / Short is a
Loan) or use of different arrows for the different relationships between Student–
Loan and Loan–Short/Long.
[4]
(d)

Award up to [3 max].
Add a static count variable;
To the shortTerm class and to the longTerm class;
A method can be called to display count by adding the two above together;

(a)

(b)

Award up to [4 max].
The books are stored in separate arrays;
In separate objects;
These can only be searched using a linear search;
As no index is available;
Also, parts of each array will be empty;
So this would be slow/inefficient;
(i)

[4]

Award up to [2 max].
A binary tree;
Using the book ID as the index;

[2]

Award up to [4 max].
Every time a loan object is created;
Book object inserted using bookID;
The student ID stored also;
To locate the student ID the binary tree would be searched;
Using the bookID;
The studentID returned;
Used to access the borrowers array to find the student name;

[4]

Award up to [4 max].
Award [1] for an advantage and [1] for an elaboration, [1] for a disadvantage and
[1] for an elaboration.
Advantage:
There will be less wasted memory;
As only the required number of locations will be used;
Disadvantage:
It will be slower to locate a specific student;
As a linear search will be needed compared to direct access with the array;

(d)

[4]

Award up to [6 max]. Award [1] for each correct line of code (shown below;
accept equivalents).
LinkedList p = new LinkedList ()
LinkedList head = p.getHead()
Set temp to head
Moving through the list
Recognizing that the last node has been reached
Setting the shortTerm object to be the last and its pointer to null
