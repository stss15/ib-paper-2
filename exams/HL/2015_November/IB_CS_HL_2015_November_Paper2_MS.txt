(a)

(b)

(c)

Award [1] for a definition, such as:
A (special) method (with the same name as the class) that instantiates an object of
that class;
Award [1] for the example:
public Patient(String i, String n, int p)

[2]

Award [1] for a field and its data type.
For example:
String phoneNumber;

[2]

Award [1] for any indication of aggregation.
Award an additional [1] for a full description.
Example answer:
The WaitingRoom object stores up to 10 instances of the Patient object;
The WaitingRoom has a Patient;
Accept a correctly labelled diagram.

(d)

Award marks as follows up to [3 max].
Award [2] for correct loop, award [1] for loop with one condition.
Award [1] for correct test.
Award [1] for assigning max.
Example answer:
int i=1;
while ((i<10) && (patients[i]!=null))
{
if (patients[i].priority > patients[max].priority)

max = i;
}
i = i+1;
}

[3]

Award marks as follows up to [6 max].
Award [1] for including the correct signature.
Award [1] for correct output of patient details.
Award [1] for any loop.
Award [1] for correct loop.
Award [1] for correct assignment to shift a patient instance.
Award [1] for assigning null.
Example answer:
public void remove(int n)
{
System.out.println(patients[n].toString());
for (int i=n; i<9; i=i+1)
{
patients[i] = patients[i+1];
}
patients[9] = null;
}

N15/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award [1] for a suitable definition, for example:
Encapsulation means having private variables;
Variables not directly accessible from outside the class;
Methods and variables are all included in the class definition;
Award [1] for relating an advantage to the Patient class, such as:
So that patient data cannot be accessed/modified accidentally;
So that patient data is more secure;

(b)

Award [1] for identifying an ethical issue and [1] for an elaboration.
Award [1] for relating this issue to the Treatment class and [1] for an elaboration.
Example answer:
Sensitive information should be separated from identity data;
In order to avoid information misuse;
The consultation object does not include the patient's name (only an ID);
So that a sensitive diagnosis (like AIDS) is not directly linked to a name;

(c)

[4]

Award marks as follows up to [3 max].
Award [1] for including String name with correct getter and setter methods.
Award [1] for including String phone with correct getter and setter methods.
Award [1] for including Boolean present with correct getter and setter methods;
Example answer:
Doctor
String name
String phone
Boolean present
setName(String name)
setPhone(String phone)
setPresent(Boolean present)
String getName()
String getPhone()
Boolean getPresent()
String toString() //optional

(d)

[2]

[3]

Award [1] for identifying an appropriate need for extended character sets and an
additional [1] for an elaboration of this need. Award [1] for relating to the Doctor
object.
Example answer:
Different languages use different characters, which are not included in the basic 8-bit
ASCII character set;
Extended character sets (like Unicode) include all possible characters from all
languages;
For example, the doctor’s name could not be spelled correctly in ASCII;

N15/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award marks as follows up to [6 max].
Award [1] for correctly initialized method.
Award [1] for creating a new Treatment object.
Award [1] for loop through treatment file.
Award [1] for setting current equal to next in file.
Award [2] for correct if statement that checks names.
Award [1] for correct output statement.
void showMedicationByDoctor(String name)
{
Treatment current;
while (treatmentFile.hasNext())
{
current = treatmentFile.getNext();
if (current.getDoctor().equals(name))
{
output(current.getMedication());
}
}
}

N15/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award marks as follows up to [6 max].
Award [1] for a common super-class.
Award [1] for all common fields: id field (integer) date field (String) doctor field
(String).
Award [1] for three sub-classes and award [1] for arrows with correct direction.
Award [1] for the medication fields in Ambulatory and InPatient, but not in
Referral.
Award [1] for the additional fields (Hospital and Ambulance) in Referral.
Award [1] for the additional fields (RoomNumber and ReleaseDate) in InPatient.
Example diagram:

Treatment
private int id;
private String date;
private Doctor doctor;

Ambulatory

Referral

private String medication;

private String hospital;
private Boolean ambulance;

InPatient
private String medication;
private String roomNumber;

Do not penalize if data types are not specified.
(b)

[6]

Award [1] for identifying each advantage and an additional [1] for an elaboration of this
advantage, up to [6 max].
Example answer:
Faster development;
Because different programming teams can work on different modules;
Easier to debug;
Because the smaller modules will have fewer mistakes than one big program;
Easier to update (in the future);
Because it is easier to update a module than the full program;
Re-usability;
Modules can be stored in libraries and reused for different programs;

Award [1] for stating an application and [1] for an elaboration.
Example answer:
The system stack stores return data of interrupted processes;

[1]

Award marks as follows up to [3 max].
Award [1] for introducing and initializing a Boolean done.
Award [1] for adding !done to the loop condition.
Award [1] for testing for early exit (current.priority==3).
Example answers:
Add a boolean done and set it to false before the loop;
Add &&(!done) to the loop condition;
if current.priority equals 3 then make done true;
boolean done = false;
while ((i < PatientList.size()) && (!done))
{
current = PatientList.get(i);
