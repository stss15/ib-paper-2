A real estate business maintains an unsorted database of houses and apartments that it tries
to sell for the property owners.
The following UML diagram describes the objects in the current system.

The object-oriented software solution that implements this system for the real estate
business allows a customer to select a maximum of 10 houses that he or she is interested in.
These houses are stored in an array wishList of type House.

(g)

Construct the code needed to instantiate an array wishList that can store a maximum
of 10 House objects.

(a)

Define the term encapsulation.

The real estate business is planning to expand its database to include student housing.
These "houses" are usually single rooms in a privately owned house.
(c)

Explain one benefit of using inheritance to create a new class Room.

[3]

Many of the prospective students have an international background.
(d)

Explain one feature of modern programming languages that allows for internationalization. [3]

All the unsorted House objects in the database have been copied to a sufficiently large array
allHouses. This array is not completely filled with House objects.
The array allHouses and all methods in this question are declared in the main program class.
All methods can access the array allHouses directly.
Consider the following method.
public void unknown(String x)
{
for (int i=O; i<allHouses.length; i++)
{
if ( allHouses [ i] . getCi ty () . equals (x) )
{
output (allHouses[i] .getAddress());

(a)

Define the term method signature.

(b)

Describe how the original String variable, passed to a method as a parameter,
can be assigned a new value by that method.

( c)

State the intended purpose of the method unknown.

(d)

(i)

Outline the runtime error that is likely to occur if this method is called.

[2]

(ii)

Outline how this error can be corrected.

[2]

(e)

Construct the code for the method house sort that will sort the array allHouses in
ascending order of price.

[2]

(1 J

[5]

A method is needed to select from the original unsorted array allHouses the three most
expensive houses below or equal to a given price.
(f)

Construct the code for the method select Three that will take an integer parameter
budget. It must return a sorted array of size 3 that contains the three most expensive
House objects (in ascending order of price) with a price that is less than or equal
to budget.
You may assume that the array allHouses contains at least three House objects
with a price less than or equal to budget. As part of your answer you should use the
method houseSort I I as developed in part (e).

Once a month the real estate business organizes an open day for a particular house.
Interested clients can sign up by giving their name and phone number to the real estate business.
This information is stored in a list node ClientNode as follows.
public class ClientNode
{
private String name;
private String phone;
private boolean attended;
private ClientNode next;
public ClientNode (String aName, String aPhone)
(
this.name = aName;
this.phone = aPhone;
this.attended= false;
this.next = null;
public String getName()
{
return this.name;
public String getClient()
{
return this.name+" "+this.phone;
public void setAttended()
{
attended= true;
public ClientNode getNext()
{
return this.next;
public void setNext(ClientNode nextNode)
{
this.next = nextNode;

(a)

Identify two features of an abstract data type (ADT).

A new class ClientList is implemented as outlined below.
public class ClientList
{
ClientNode root;
// default constructor
void enList(ClientNode visitor)
{
... adds visitor to the end of the list - missing code _
boolean isEmpty()
return (root==null);
... more methods ...
A list openDay has been instantiated of the type ClientList.

Describe the meaning of the following statement.

[3)

open Day. enList (new ClientNode ("Sophie Bella", "072 456721") ) ;
(c)

By using object references, construct the method enList that allows a client to be
added to the end of the list open Day.

[5]

The attendance of potential buyers is tracked during the open day by changing the at tended
variable to true when a potential buyer arrives.
At the end of the day, the list open Day is processed so that every potential buyer that
attended is added to new list hasAttended and every potential buyer that did not attend is
added to a new list notAttended.
(d)

Without writing code, outline the steps involved in splitting the list openDay into a list
hasAttended and a list notAttended.

(Option D, question 16 continued)
The real estate business keeps the data of all past owners in a file for future reference.
This file is sorted by owner name. When needed, this file is read into a LinkedList called
contacts, which has been instantiated as follows.
private LinkedList<Owner> contacts = new LinkedList<Owner>();
(e)

Construct a recursive binary search method given as
public Owner binSearch(String name, int low, int high)
where name is the search term.
You may assume that contacts is accessible to binSearch and that it has been filled
with many objects.
You may use the following standard LinkedList method.
. get(int index)
This returns the object located in the LinkedList at index.
