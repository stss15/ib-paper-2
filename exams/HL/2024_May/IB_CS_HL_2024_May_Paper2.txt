Option D — Object-oriented programming
14.

A car rental company has offices in cities in Spain and Portugal. It manages its cars as
a large, unsorted collection of rental objects that is accessed by a Java program.
The following UML diagram describes the current main Rental class. Fuel type and
transmission type were chosen to be Boolean because they have two choices: petrol
or diesel for fuel type, and manual or automatic for transmission type.
The brand and the model of the car are stored together as one string brandModel.
Typically the company has many cars of the same brand and model.

- numberPlate: String

+ default constructor
+ accessor and mutator methods

(a)

Outline the general nature of an object.

[2]

(b)

State one mutator method to be included in the class Rental.[1]

(c)

Construct the code for the accessor method getBrandModel().[3]

(d)

Outline one purpose of a default constructor.

[2]

The company is buying new electric cars and hybrid cars.
(e)

Outline one change that needs to be made to class Rental due to this development.

[2]

Based on this Rental class, the program defines several other classes: Car, Bus and
Van, each with their own characteristics. For example, the class Car adds the attribute
numberOfDoors to the class Rental.
(f)

State the relationship between Rental and Car.[1]

(g)

Construct the code for the class Car without having to duplicate all the attributes and
methods from the class Rental. The default constructor of the class Rental should
be overridden to also assign the value 4 to numberOfDoors. No other constructors
are required.

(a)	Identify the OOP feature that was used to declare the Car class.

[1]

(b)

Explain the benefits of the feature identified in part (a).[3]

(c)

Identify the two other features of OOP.

[2]

(d)

Describe one advantage of modularity in program development.

[2]

All Car objects have been read into a large unsorted array called allCars.
A method is needed to show customers the range of available cars.
This method should take the array allCars as a parameter and select Car objects from
allCars so that every available brandModel is presented only once.
You may assume that there are never more than 100 different types of cars (as identified by
the variable brandModel).
(a)

Define the term parameter variable.[2]

(b)

Construct the code for the method findBrandModels() that will take the array
allCars as a parameter. It must return a Car array that contains every brandModel
that is available without duplication.

[8]

A customer wants to see which different types of cars are available. The criteria are it must
be a petrol car with automatic transmission and cost less than 35 euros per day.
(c)

17.

Without writing code, outline the steps needed for a method to perform this query and
present the results to the customer.

[5]

The car rental company also has a database of customers. For each customer it stores an
object with personal data such as their ID, name and address.
This Customer object includes the history of the cars they have rented and the car they are
currently renting (if any).
(a)

Draw the relationship between Customer and Car objects.

[1]

A suggestion has been made to modify the Rental class to include customerID.
The intention is to make it easier to find the customer who has a certain car.
(b)

Describe in terms of dependencies why this suggestion is inappropriate.

[2]

(c)

Explain the ethical obligations for programmers when developing a customer database.

The car rental company stores details of its customers as objects of a Customer class,
as follows.
public class Customer
{
private String customerID;
private String name;
// more personal data
private CarList history;
private String level;
// constructors
// all getter and setter methods

}

public void updateHistory(Car newCar)
{
// missing code
}

Where the class CarList is declared as:
public class CarList
{
private CarNode root;
// default constructor
public void addToFront(Car newCar)
{
// missing code
}
public boolean isEmpty()
{
return (root  null);
}
public int count()
{
// missing code
}
}

// returns the number of Cars in history

… more methods …

The class CarNode is declared as:
public class CarNode
{
private Car aCar;
private CarNode next;
public CarNode (Car newCar)
{
this.aCar  newCar;
this.next  null;
}
}

(a)

// getter and setter methods

By using object references, construct the method addToFront in class CarList that
allows a new car to be added to the front of the list.

The company has a loyalty program with 4 levels (basic, silver, gold and diamond). The more
cars you rent, the higher your level and the bigger your benefits.

When a customer returns a car, the program will add the Car object to the start of their
history list. Then it will count the cars in the history list and finally it will determine
and save the new status of the customer.
(b)

Construct the method updateHistory(Car newCar) in the Customer class,
that will perform the following tasks:
y add newCar to the start of the carList history
y count the number of cars in the carList history
y update the customer’s status.
You can use any previously developed methods.

19.

The extensive customer database of the car rental company is saved in a collection and
needs to be read into an abstract data structure to ensure that searches can be done quickly.
(a)

Outline why a linked list is slower to search than a binary tree.

The following class TNode has been defined to store Customer objects in a binary search tree.
public class TNode
{
private TNode left;
private Customer data;
private TNode right;
public TNode(Customer newCustomer)
{
left  null;
data  newCustomer;
right  null;
}
}

// getter and setter methods

Figure 12 shows a representation of the way customers are stored in the binary search tree.
The nodes only show the customerID. However, each node stores a full Customer object.

(Option D, question 19 continued)
Consider the following recursive algorithm.
public void print(TNode node)
{
if (node ! null)
{
print(node.left);
output(node.data.getCustomerID());
print(node.right);
}
}

(b)

State the output for the call print(root) given in Figure 12.[2]

The output of the call print(root) is used to construct a new binary search tree.
(c)

Sketch the resulting binary search tree using your output from part (b) as sequential
input to create the new tree.

[3]

A new method is required to add the Customer objects from the binary tree to a sequential
collection called myCollection. The order of the Customer objects in the collection must
enable the tree to be restored in its original binary search tree form when the customers are
read in a sequential order from myCollection.
(d)

Construct the recursive code for a method storeBST() that will allow the binary tree of
customers to be stored appropriately in myCollection.
You may assume a method myCollection.add(Customer aCustomer) exists that
appends aCustomer to the end of the sequential collection of customers.
