(a)

(b)

Award up to [2 marks max].
It is the method that instantiates/creates a new object;
It may be used to initialize variables (of the new object);

[2 marks]

Award [1 mark] for identifying an advantage.
Award [1 mark] for identifying an example.
Award [1 mark] for an elaboration.
Example:
Polymorphism allows an external program to use the same method action on all
subclasses;
By allowing overridden functions in child classes to add only the code that is
needed for the unique processing of that sub-class;
In this example, the getWeight() method returns the weight of each piece of
RollingStock. In the case of a wagon, the additional computation needed to add
the weight of the cargo is added;

Award [1 mark] for correct member functions.

Award [1 mark] for correct function declaration line, including public.
Award [1 mark] for reducing WagonCount.
Award [1 mark] for return statement.
Award [1 mark] for returning the correct object.
Award [1 mark] for checking the value of the counter.
Example:
public Wagon removeWagon()
{
if (mWagonCount > 0 )
{
mWagonCount--;
return mWagons[mWagonCount];
}
else
{
return null;
}
}

(a)

[5 marks]

Award [1 mark] for stating an advantage and [1 mark] for a more complete
outline, up to [2 marks max].
Example:
Supports code reuse;
Programmers can select an appropriate object class from the library and not have
to design, implement and test it;
[2 marks]

(b)

Award [1 mark] for stating the difference and [1 mark] for describing it, for two
differences, up to [4 marks max].
Example:
Programmers can be specialized;
Some programmers can develop special expertise in testing, while others focus on
User Interfaces, etc;
Information hiding can be used to reduce module dependencies;
Different programmers can work on different classes independently because the
internals of those classes are hidden;
Easier to resolve problems when many heads;

It needs to modify the instance variable declarations;
Change the formal parameters of the constructor;
Add “get” and “set” methods;

[3 marks]

(e)

Inheritance avoids duplicating code in the two new classes;
The new DestinationAddress class will have a member variable to store the
special delivery instructions;
The OriginAddress class will have a member variable indicating where the
parcel was collected from;
They will inherit common attributes from the parent;
Examples of these;

Award [1 mark] for calling getWeight() on parent class.
Award [1 mark] for adding weight of individual parcels in a loop.
Award [1 mark] for using correct loop index endpoints.
Award [1 mark] for returning the correct value.
Example:
public double getWeight()
{
double totalWeight = super.getWeight();
// or totalWeight = 32000;
for(int i=0; i < mParcelCount; i++)
{
totalWeight += mParcels[i].getWeight();

Award [1 mark] for intitializing total weight to zero.
Award [1 mark] for correctly adding the weights of all the engines.
Award [1 mark] for correctly adding the weights of all the wagons.
Award [1 mark] for returning the correct value.
Example:
public double getWeight()
{
double totalWeight = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < mEngineCount; i++ )
{
totalWeight += mEngines[i].getWeight();
}
for (int i = 0; i < mWagonCount; i++ )
{
totalWeight += mWagons[i].getWeight();
}
return totalWeight;

The compiler can tell which is which;
The compiler checks to see what class of object the method is being invocated on
and therefore choose the correct one;
They are in different classes;
[2 marks]

(a)

Modify the Wagon class to have a nextWagon member variable;
Modify the Train class / Driver class to have a firstWagon member variable;
Modify the addWagon() and removeWagon() methods to implement the
linked list;
[3 marks]

(b)

Award [1 mark] for the correct function header.
Award [1 mark] for making the nextWagon point to the current firstWagon.
Award [1 mark] for making the firstWagon point to the new Wagon.
Example:

(c)

(d)

public void addWagon(Wagon newWagon)
{
newWagon.nextWagon = firstWagon;
firstWagon = newWagon;
}

[3 marks]

Award up to [5 marks max].
The method would have to take an ID number as an argument;
It would start with the first Wagon stored in the Train class;
Check if the Wagon ID matched;
If so, remove that Wagon by altering the links;
If not, follow the link to the next Wagon;
It should return null if there is no Wagon with the ID number specified is found;

Award [1 mark] for stating a reason for a naming convention, and a further
[1 mark] for elaborating.
Points to consider:
Meaningful identifiers, proper indentation and adequate comments all improve the
readability of code for humans and thus save money, time and effort in
programming teams.
