Option D — Object-oriented programming
15.

(a)

public;
Allows access to variables from outside of the class/unlimited access;
protected;
Allows access to variable from within the package (project) in which they are
created/subclasses;
final;
Prevents variables from being modified;
static;
Refers to variables that act on the class as a whole (and not on individual
objects);

Note:
 Accept at most one example pertaining to methods.
 Do not accept two examples pertaining to the same modifier.

[4]

The OOP feature shown in the constructors (accept the 2 signatures) is
overloading (accept polymorphism);
The constructor methods have a different number / type of parameters / different
parameters;
The method calling the constructor / compiler will determine which of these
methods is selected;
By matching up with the parameters;

[4]

(c)

Silver;

[1]

(d)

Through the use of the (appropriate) array index / appropriate code description;

(b)

Example:
Individual object = allVisits[individual object’s location]
(e)

[1]

public boolean isGold()
{
return (statusNow.equals("Gold"); // allows =
}

Award marks as follows:
Signature;
Correct comparison (allow use of getStatusNow());
Return (that matches the signature – allow FT);
Note:
 Allow the equivalent use of IF/THEN statements.
 Do not accept parameters to be passed.
 Do not allow the use of totalPoints.

M18/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award [1] for three compartments, [1] for correct + and –, and [1] for correct
contents.
Visits
- hotelCode: String
- days: int
+ Visits(String, int)
+ getDays():int

(b)

(c)

Note:
 allow variations in the format, but must use + / –
 accept additional getters/setters, but the given content must be present.

Example 1:
public int calculateTotalPoints()
{
int totalPoints = 0;
for (int x = 0; x < y; x++)
{
totalPoints = totalPoints + allVisits[x].getDays();
}
totalPoints = totalPoints * 1000 + bonusPoints;
return totalPoints;
}
Award marks for correctly including the following:
Signature + matching return;
Loop through the number of visits (y); // do not allow length statements;
Any use of allVisits array;
Correct update of totalPoints (with or without bonusPoints);
Inclusion of bonus points outside of the loop (or if the loop is absent);
Example 2:
public int calculateTotalPoints()
{
int totalDays = 0;
for (int x = 0; x < y; x++)
{
totalDays = totalDays + allVisits[x].getDays();
}
totalPoints = totalDays * 1000 + bonusPoints;
return totalPoints;
}

public int daysMissing()
{
int pointsNeeded = 0;
int points;
// convert present status to minimum number of days
if (statusNow.equals("Silver"))
// allow = or use of
// isSilver()
pointsNeeded = 10000;
else if (statusNow.equals("Gold")) // allow = or use of
// isGold()
pointsNeeded = 50000;
points = pointsNeeded - calculateTotalPoints();
if (points > 0) // might be negative
{
return points/1000;
}
else
{
return 0;
}
}

Award marks for correctly including the following:
Signature + return of an integer;
All required declaration (initialization if needed);
Conversion to points/days for all 3 statuses // bronze can be the default;
Calculation of points missing (allow getTotalPoints() or the variable
totalPoints for calculateTotalPoints()) ;
Convert to days (divide by 1000) // allow if the conversion has already taken place;
Returning calculated number; // allow even if negative or if incorrect or without an
if else clause;
Returning 0 // when the points needed would have been negative / when
required points have already been gained;
(e)

A generic class / Status / Point / Bronze class can be used as a superclass;
Sub-classes can then be created (2 or 3) for the individual statuses;
Containing elements specific to them / overriding superclass methods;
And inheriting methods/variables required by all status levels from the
superclass;
Do not award more than [2] for a generic response.

(f)

[7]

[4]

(In the Points class) statusNow = statusNextYear;
bonusPoints set to 0 (accept reset bonusPoints);
totalPoints set to 0 (accept reset totalPoints);
variable y (that counts the visits) needs to be set to 0;
statusNextYear = Bronze (accept reset statusNextYear);
Note: Do not accept “array allVisits reinitialised to empty”.

M18/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award up to [ 7 max]. Note there are 9 marking points.
An array of objects / 2 parallel arrays would be created / any other appropriate
structure; // Do not allow 2D array;
Containing hotel codes and number of days;
Repeat/loop for each object in the allVisits array;
 Inspect the hotel ids and days stayed / find a matching hotel;
 Update the array(s); // see first note below
 By increasing the number of days (for the specific hotel);
Sort / search / look for / find; // see first note below;
The object / hotel code with the largest number of days;
Find the name of the hotel using the hotel code / Hotel class;
Note:
 mps can be awarded even if the wrong values are being updated or searched for
(eg stays instead of days).
 For mp 7 only allow the use of “look for” and “find” if accompanied by a suitable
description.

(a)

M18/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Example 1:
The link list will enable space to be allocated dynamically/will only take up the
space required;
Because the number of customers is unknown / customers may join or leave the
loyalty scheme during the year;
Example 2:
Customers / objects / nodes can be easily added or deleted;
so customers may join or leave the loyalty scheme during the year;

(b)

[2]

public ArrayList goldMails()
{
ArrayList al = new ArrayList(); // Allow use of <String> identifier
int s = allCustomers.size();
int x = 0;
while(!(allPoints[x] == null)) // Allow(allPoints[x]!=null)
{
if (allPoints[x].isGold())
{
String a = allPoints[x].getMemberId();
for (int y = 0; y < s; y++)
{
String b = allCustomers.get(y).getMemberId();
if (a.equals(b)) // allow =
al.add(allCustomers.get(y).getEmail());
}
}
x = x + 1
}
return al;
}

Award marks as follows:
Declaring a new ArrayList (with or without the String identifier);
Looping through the allPoints array;
Testing for “Gold”;
Loping through the allCustomers linked list (using the size or an iterator);
Correct check for identical ids;
Adding the email to the ArrayList;
Returning the arraylist;
Note:
 Do not allow any methods that are not part of the LinkedList or ArrayList
library classes – eg the length function for the linked list is invalid.
 Do not penalize more than once for omitting the “gets”.
 Allow the for loop: for (Customer currCust : allCustomers).
 Allow for loop instead of a while loop.
