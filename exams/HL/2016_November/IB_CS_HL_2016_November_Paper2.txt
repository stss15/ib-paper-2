Option B — Modelling and simulation
5.

The population of rare tropical insects on an island follows a geometric model such that the
population multiplies by k from one month to the next.
For example if k = 2 the population would double each month.
This situation can be expressed as either Pn+1 = kPn or Pn = P0 kn.
P0 is the initial population.
k is a constant.
Pn is the population after n months.
(a)

For a value of k = 3 and an initial population of 100, calculate the population after two
months, P2.[2]

(b)

With the aid of a diagram, outline the way in which a spreadsheet could be used to
estimate the size of the population after each of the first 10 months.

[3]

Each month it is estimated that only 40 % of insects survive due to various circumstances
such as climate and lack of nutrition. This is known as a constant survival rate of 0.4.
(c)

Outline how this factor could be built into your spreadsheet, stating any assumptions
that you make.

[2]

Another model assumes a changing survival rate and recalculates the rate for each month
using the following formula:

xn+1 = r xn (1 − xn) where xn is the survival rate in month n. (0 < xn < 1)
r is a constant.

For example, using r = 3 and a survival rate of 0.4 in the first month, the survival rate for the
second month would be:

x2 = r x1 (1 − x1) = 3 × 0.4 × 0.6 = 0.72.
(d)

Construct an algorithm to calculate and output survival rates for the first 10 months,
assuming that r = 3 and an initial survival rate of 0.4.

[5]

The following table shows a comparison between a model with a constant survival rate of
0.4 and a model with a changing survival rate, for the first nine months.

Influenza is a contagious disease and a new form is spreading throughout a city.  Some
people are affected more than others and the illness is spreading more quickly in some parts
of the city than in others. Members of the public can be given a vaccine that will prevent

Bridges are modelled and these models are tested using sophisticated software before being
presented for construction.
The software enables the architect to:
• define the shape of the bridge
• apply parameters such as width, length and material to the structure
• view the bridge from different perspectives
• test the strength and stability of the bridge under all conditions.
The architect starts by defining the basic shape of the required bridge.  This includes the
span of the bridge (from one end to the other), and the struts (pillars) that are needed to
support the bridge. During this phase the architect has a wire frame image to work with.
When the design is complete, the image is rendered to give a solid view of the bridge.
(a)

Outline the way in which the wire frame image can be used by the architect to adjust
the parameters and view the bridge from many different perspectives.

[3]

(b)

Describe how the wire frame image of the bridge is held in memory.

(c)

Suggest reasons for making changes on the wire frame model rather than the
solid view model.
