Option A — Databases
1.

CrossCountryXL is a transport company that delivers items from different retailers.
Each retailer has many suppliers.
(a)

Construct the entity-relationship diagram for this scenario.

[3]

CrossCountryXL constructs a relational database to store data about the items that suppliers
supply to retailers. The following tables form part of this database.
• The SUPPLIER table contains contact details for each supplier. Each supplier supplies
only one item
• The SUPPLY table identifies the supplier’s item. The attribute “Nature_Of_Goods” takes a
value of “P” for perishable or “NP” for non-perishable items
• The ITEM table contains the item details.
Some of the data in these tables is shown below and on the following page. The underlined
attribute indicates the primary key in each table.

An estate agent calculates the estimated selling price of properties within a town, according
to the following criteria:
•
•
•
•

the size (in square metres) of the property
whether the property is a house or an apartment
the district in which the property is located (the town is divided into districts 1, 2, 3 and 4)
the condition of the property, rated “very good”, “good”, “medium”, “poor” or “very poor”.

A mathematical model is set up to store the above variables for each property that is for sale,
and to calculate the estimated selling price.
(a)

Outline, with an example, a suitable way of representing each of the variables that is
needed to store the information in a spreadsheet. 

[4]

The rules for the model are as follows:
• initial value of an apartment = $2000 per square metre
• initial value of a house = $2300 per square metre
• a multiplier is then applied according to the district in which the property is located:
1.25, 1.00, 0.95 or 0.90, where the most popular district (district 1) has a multiplier of 1.25
and the least popular district (district 4) has a multiplier of 0.90
• another multiplier is applied, based on the condition of the property. For example, a house
in good condition has a multiplier of 1.00.
(b)

Using a spreadsheet, construct a model which uses the values of the variables from
part (a) to find the appropriate multipliers and calculate the estimated price for a property.

[6]

The estate agent uses the spreadsheet to calculate the estimated price and to store the
date on which the property was first for sale. When a property is sold the final selling price
and the date sold are recorded. Properties are not always sold at the price estimated by the
estate agent.
(c)

Suggest how the data from sold properties could be used to test and change the rules
of the model.

[3]

(d)

Suggest ways in which the estate agent could use the model to identify the
characteristics that make a property difficult to sell.

A railway company has ticket machines and manually operated ticket offices in all of its
stations. There are two types of ticket machine:
Type 1: where tickets which have been purchased online can be collected.
Type 2: where tickets can be bought by selecting a journey and date.
The ticket offices are manned by employees who sell and renew season tickets and can also
carry out the same functions as the Type 2 ticket machines.
The distribution of machines and ticket offices at each station causes some problems.
Customers complain that:
• the ticket offices are often closed when they are needed.
• during busy periods they have to wait too long at the ticket machines and sometimes miss
trains that they have already booked online.
The railway company decides to run computer simulations to compare different ways of
organizing the numbers and types of machines and ticket offices in one particular station.

Following the eruption of a volcano in a mountainous region, isolated groups of endangered
animals are displaced across a large area.
A computer-manned aircraft is used to identify the positions of the groups. The optimum path
to the groups is then calculated, so that they can be reached by conservationists.
(a)

Outline the use of a genetic algorithm to determine this optimum path.

[5]

The positions change on a daily basis as the groups of animals move. A neural network is
used, together with a map of the area, to attempt to establish the pattern of movement.
(b)

Compare supervised and unsupervised learning and suggest which is more suitable in
this case.

[6]

A scientist proposes that a series of robots placed close to the known volcanic area could
communicate the state of the volcano prior to an eruption.
Communication between robots involves the use of sensors. Appropriately programmed, the
robots could communicate the state of the volcano to each other. Communication between
humans involves natural language and the information about the volcano would need to be
relayed to humans.

Clients can book over the internet and are allocated a room on arrival. When a booking is
made, a Client object is added to a linked list, Bookings, which is linked in order of the
client’s arrival time, stored in arrive.
If any Client objects have the same arrival date they are ordered so that the most recently
added object will appear first in the linked list.
The Dates class contains two methods to compare dates:
• public static Dates compareDate(Dates x, Dates y)
which returns the earlier of the two dates
• public static Boolean equalDate(Dates x, Dates y)
which returns true if the dates are the same.
In answering parts (a) and (b), you should use the methods of the LinkedList class.

in Bookings.[6]

arrive that day.
