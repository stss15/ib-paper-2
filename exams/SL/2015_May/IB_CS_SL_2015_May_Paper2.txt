Option D — Object-oriented programming
A library in a college loans books to students.
The current book borrowing system, which was developed years ago, is prone to error.  You are a
member of the new program development team which has decided to develop a system using an
object-oriented programming (OOP) approach.  The team will be divided into small sub-groups.
The program development team is aware of the following user requirements.
• Certain books are classified as short term and can only be borrowed for 5 days.  Other books
are classified as long term and can be borrowed for 30 days.
• Fines are charged at a rate of $1.50 for each day that a short term book is overdue.
• Fines are charged at a rate of 10 cents for each day that a long term book is overdue.
• If the overdue period exceeds 4 days for any short term loan book students are not allowed to
borrow any more books and their borrowing rights are suspended; this does not apply for long
term book loans.
• Students can borrow a total of 10 books.

(a)

Outline two advantages that the programming team should expect from using an OOP
approach.		

[4]

(b)

Explain two ethical issues which should be taken into account when working on
the project.

Following some analysis, the team determined that the Loan and Student classes will be
used.  Part of the Student class is shown below.
import java.util.*;
public class Student
{
		private int studentID;
		private String studentName;
		private Loan[] booksBorrowed = new Loan[10];
		private int numBooks = 0;
		public Student(int studentID, String studentName)
		{
			this.studentID=studentID;
			this.studentName=studentName;
		}
		public Loan getLoan (int x)
		{
			return this.booksBorrowed[x];
		}
		public void addLoan(Loan book)
		{
			this.booksBorrowed[numBooks] = book;
			numBooks++;
		}
		public int getStudentID()
		{
			return this.studentID;
		}
		public String getStudentName()
		{
			return this.studentName;
		}
}

When creating objects, encapsulation is an important design consideration.
(c)

Outline, with direct reference to the Student class, how security can be enhanced by
using encapsulation.

[3]

To use the Student class in a program an object has to be created or instantiated.
(d)

Construct a statement to create a Student object for a student with an ID of 93003
and a name of “Smith”.

(Option D, question 10 continued)
The basic Loan class is shown below.  Every time a book is borrowed, an instance of the
Loan class is created.  In the Student class, the books borrowed by a single student are
stored in an array called booksBorrowed.
import java.util.*;
public class Loan
{
		
private int bookID;
		
private String bookTitle;
		
private Date d;
		
static int numBooksLoaned = 0;
		
public Loan(int bookID, String bookTitle)
		{
			 this.bookID = bookID;
			 this.bookTitle = bookTitle;
			 this.d = new Date(); //set date borrowed
			 numBooksLoaned = numBooksLoaned +1;
		}
		
public int getBookID()
		{
			return this.bookID;
		}
		
public String getBookTitle()
		{
			return this.bookTitle;
		}
		
public Date getDate()
		{
			return this.d;
		}
		
public void setBookID(int id)
		{
			 this.bookID = id;
		}
		
public void setBookTitle(String title)
		{
			 this.bookTitle = title;
		}
		
public void setDate(Date d)
		{
			 this.d = d;
		}
}

Note the use of the keyword static in the statement static int numBooksLoaned = 0
and that this term is not used in the other variable declarations.
(e)

Explain the use of the term static for the variable numBooksLoaned in the Loan class.

[3]

(f)

Construct the code needed to add a loan with a book ID of 212000 and a book title of
“The Stars” to a Student object, ST.

In order to store each Student object the team has decided to use the borrowers array of
type Student.  The team has also decided to use the student’s ID as the index into the array.  
For example, a Student object with a student ID of 1111 would have its reference stored in
position 1111 of the array.
Consider the code fragment below which would appear in a suitably constructed main class.
public static void main(String[] args)
{
Student temp;
Student[] borrowers = new Student[100000];
temp = new Student(93001, "Jones");
temp.addLoan(new Loan(210001,"The Sky"));
borrowers[93001] = temp;
temp = new Student(3012, "Zang");
temp.addLoan(new Loan(210121, "The Animals"));
borrowers[3012] = temp;
borrowers[93001].addLoan(new Loan(210002, "The Spooks"));
temp = new Student(93002, "Nguyen");
temp.addLoan(new Loan(210011, "The Ocean"));
borrowers[93002] = temp;

}

(a)

System.out.println(borrowers[93001].getStudentName());
System.out.println(borrowers[93001].getLoan(1).getBookTitle());
System.out.println(borrowers[3012].getLoan(0).getBookTitle());

Determine the output from the following statements.

		(i)

System.out.println(borrowers[93001].getStudentName());

[1]

		(ii)

System.out.println(borrowers[93001].getLoan(1).getBookTitle());

[1]

		(iii)

System.out.println(borrowers[3012].getLoan(0).getBookTitle());

[1]

The librarian requires a display of the student name, the titles of the books and the dates that
they were borrowed, corresponding to a specific student ID.
(b)

Construct the method showDetails() that could be used in the main class,
which accepts a student ID as a parameter, and then uses this to access the
appropriate Student object producing the desired output as indicated above.

[7]

(c)

State three aspects of the user requirements that are not addressed by the current
design.

[3]

(d)

Describe a modification to the Student class that would address one of the missing
requirements.

The team has decided to use inheritance in its design.
(a)

Describe one benefit that inheritance brings to OOP.

[2]

Two sub-classes will be created: shortTerm and longTerm.
(b)

State two additional attributes that each shortTerm object should have.

[2]

(c)

Construct a suitable UML diagram showing the relationships between the Student
class, the Loan superclass and the two sub-classes. Note: there is no need to include
the attributes or methods of each class.

[4]

Outline, using an OOP technique, how the total number of books on loan could be
displayed without processing the borrowers array.
