Option D — Object-oriented programming
10.

(a)

Award up to [3] marks.
Note: An example is required with detailed explanation (up to [2 max];
Award [1 max] if there is lack of detail).
A class describes/provides the template for a particular object;
Whereas an instantiation of a class actually creates an object for that class;
For example:
An employee class would contain characteristics/actions that describe
an employee, and an instantiation would represent a particular employee;

(b)

[3]

Award marks as follows up to [4 max]:
Award up to [2 max] for each of the two required examples (award [1] mark for correct
example but lack of terminology/detail/competence)
Note: Examples should show competent use of terminology in describing the use of
inheritance, to get full marks.
The responses should focus on these aspects, with keywords underlined:
 Several sub-classes can inherit characteristics from a superclass;
 Whilst adding specific characteristics particular to themselves;
Examples can then expand or be described to include the features above.
For example:
There could be a “GUI” superclass that contains the main elements for the UIs
with the GUI for each screen inheriting from its parent;
For example:
An “Employee” superclass that allows the different types of employees to inherit
standard characteristics;

(c)

[4]

Award up to [3 max]:
Library programs are programs that have already been written;
They are standard/frequently used programs;
Development time will be saved if they can be incorporated into the design;
They have been tested / Will be free of bugs;
Note: Allow [1 mark] for responses that include examples that expand on any of the aspects
listed above.
[3]

11.

(a)

Award [max 2 marks]:
[1 mark] for each of the two correct assignments.
public SalesPerson (String id)
{
this.id = id;
salesHistory = new Sales [100];
}

Note: Allow any reasonable value for the number of Sales objects.

(b)

M17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award up to [3 max].
Note: Use of competent/detailed terminology (underlined) is required.
As the variables are declared as private;
They/their values cannot be accessed directly from outside this class;
Therefore, public accessor methods are needed to permit access;

[3]

Note: Either accessor or access required.
(c)

(i)

Award up to [4 max] as follows (there are 5 marking points):
[1] for two classes BOTH with basic three-tier structure layout;
[1] for correct dependency shown (eg diamond arrow) /
“has a” from SalesPerson to Sales/
1:N relation.
[1] in SalesPerson, for all vars and methods (contentwise) with type
(allow if constructor/ accessor/mutator methods are present);
[1] in Sales, for all vars and methods (contentwise) with type
(allow if constructor/ accessor/mutator methods are present);
[1] for correct use of +/- for public/private;

SalesPerson
- id: String
- salesHistory: Sales[]
- count: int

Sales
- itemId: String
- value: double
- quantity: int

+ double calcTotalSales()
+ Sales largestSale()

[4]

(ii)

Award up to [2 marks].
Any change in the Sales class might require a rewriting of some
SalesPerson methods/might not work;
For example, the calcTotalSales() is dependent upon/uses data from
the Sales
class;

[2]

Note: Accept any reasonable example.
(d)

Award up to [4 marks].

(e)

M17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award marks up to [5 max] as follows:
[1] for assigning an appropriate value to total;
[1] for correct loop;
[2] for correctly updating total OR [1] for a reasonable effort;
[1] for returning the total;
public double calcTotalSales() // returns total value of all
// of the sales
{
double total = 0;
for (int x = 0; x<count; x++)
{
total = total + salesHistory[x].getValue()
*salesHistory[x].getQuantity();
}
return total;
}

(f)

M17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award marks as follows up to [5 max]:
[1] for correct initialization;
[1] for correct loop;
[1] for correct comparison AND [1] for correct reassignment of total;
Note: Award [1 max] for these two parts if dot notation is not used.
Award [1] for correct re-assignment of index;
public String highest()
{
double total = 0;
int index = -1;
for (int x=0; x<100; x++)
{
if (SalesPeople[x].calcTotalSales() > total)
{
total = SalesPeople[x].calcTotalSales();
index = x;
}
}
return SalesPeople[index].getId();
}

[5]
Note: There will be other correct versions, but the markscheme shown above
should still apply.

M17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award marks up to [4 max] as follows:
[1] for correct loop;
[1] for correct comparison (either as part of the loop condition, or within a for loop);
[1] for assignment (with or without use of set);
[1] for correct use of get / set methods.
Note: Allow for a “follow through” (FT) if the loop is incorrect
Example of solution with while-loop
public void addSales(Sales s, String id)
{
int x = 0;
while (salesPeople[x].getId() != id)
{
x++;
}
salesPeople[x].setSalesHistory(s);
}

Example of solution with for-loop
public void addSales(Sales s, String id)
{
for(int i=0;i<salesPeople.length; i++)
{
if(salesPeople[i].getId().equals(id))
{
salesPeople[i].setSalesHistory(s);
break;
}
}
}

(h)

[4]

Award up to [3 max]:
A date variable must be added to the Sales class;
And included in its constructor;
Get/set methods added for the date;
The calcTotalSales() would have to be rewritten;
Note: The spirit of the question is to address the question from a programmer/developer
point of view. We are looking for elements of programming/functionality of the programs.
Please take this perspective when marking vague responses.

M17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Award up to [3 max]:
This is shown by the two constructors in the SalesPerson class;
Which is an example of overloading;
The constructor that is executed (by the compiler);
Is the one in which the parameters match up with the arguments in the calling
statement;
