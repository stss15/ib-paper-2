Option D - Object-oriented programming
An airport uses an object-oriented program to keep track of arrivals and departures of planes.
There are many objects in this system and some are listed below.
Flight

Each Flight has many attributes including a unique ID code.

Arrival

In addition to a variable of the type Flight, each Arrival has a
Scheduled Time of Arrival (STA) in 24-hour format, a runway number,
a gate code, a delay time (in minutes) and an indicator whether the
airplane has landed.

FlightManagement

The main class that manages the arrival and departure of all flights.

The code below outlines the Arrival class used in this program.
public class Flight
{ private String id;
public String getId() {return this.id;}
// ... more variables, accessor and mutator methods
}

public class Arrival
{ private Flight myFlight;
private String sta;
// Scheduled Time of Arrival ("hh:mm")
private int runway;
private String gate;
private int delay;
private boolean landed;
public Arrival(Flight myFlight, String sta)
{ this.myFlight = myFlight;
		this.sta = sta;
		this.runway = 0;
		this.gate = null;
		this.delay = 0;
		this.landed = false;
}
public void addDelay(int newDelay)
{ this.delay = newDelay;
}

public String getETA()
{ // calculates the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) of the flight
		 // by adding the delay to the sta and returning the result as a
		 // String ("hh:mm")
}
public int compareWith(String flightID)
{ if (myFlight.getID().equals(flightID)) { return 0; }
		else { return 1; }
}
public int compareWith(Arrival anotherArrival)
{ // missing code
}

}

// ... plus accessor and mutator methods

(a) (i)

Outline the general nature of an object. [2]

(ii) Describe two disadvantages of using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). [4]

(iii) Outline one advantage of using modularity in program development. [2]

(b) State the relationship between the Flight object and the Arrival object. [1]

(c) Construct a UML diagram to represent the Arrival object. [4]

The code below outlines part of the FlightManagement class used in this program.
For the purposes of this exam only arriving flights are being considered.
public class FlightManagement
{
private Arrival[] inbound;
private int last = -1;

// array of inbound airplanes
// index of last used entry

public FlightManagement()
{ inbound = new Arrival[200];
}
public void add(Arrival newArrival)
{ // missing code that adds the newArrival to the array inbound
		 // sorted by ETA, and updates last
}
private int search (String flightID)
{ // missing code that searches the array inbound and
// returns the index of the Arrival object with flightID
}
public Arrival remove(String flightID)
{ Arrival result;
		int index = search(flightID);
		 result = inbound[index];
		while (index < last)
		 { inbound[index] = inbound[index + 1];
			index++;
		}
		last--;
		return result;
}
}

// ... many more methods

The method search in the FlightManagement class searches the array inbound and
returns the index of the Arrival object with the given flightID.

(d) Construct the method search() implementing a linear search. Use the first
compareWith() method in the Arrival object.
You may assume that an Arrival object with the given flightID exists in the array
inbound.

(e)

(i) Outline one advantage of using a binary search. [2]

(ii) Outline one disadvantage of using a binary search. [2]

11.

(a) Outline the use of data-hiding as a security feature in OOP. [2]

(b) (i) Outline why calling the compareWith method does not cause a conflict. [2]

(ii) State the name of this OOP property. [1]

The method compareWith(Arrival anotherArrival) compares the Estimated Time of
Arrival (ETA) of the current Arrival object with the ETA of another Arrival object. The
method should return a negative value if the current Arrival object’s ETA is less than the
ETA of anotherArrival.
Remember that the String class contains a method compareTo() as follows:
given two String variables A and B,
A.compareTo(B) < 0 when A is lexicographically smaller than B
A.compareTo(B) = 0 when A is equal to B
A.compareTo(B) > 0 when A is lexicographically bigger than B.

(c) Construct the code for this method compareWith(). [3]

12.

(a) Define the term method signature. [2]

The array inbound in the FlightManagement class is sorted by Estimated Time of Arrival
(ETA).

(b) (c)

Construct a method showDelayed() that outputs the IDs of all delayed flights in the
array inbound that have not yet landed and that have an ETA before a given time t.
The time t is passed as a String parameter. [4]

Without using a sorting algorithm, construct the method add(Arrival newArrival)
that inserts a newArrival in the sorted array inbound. You may assume that
newArrival has been instantiated and that the array inbound is not full. [6]

When a flight is delayed, a method in FlightManagement is used to find and update the
flight with the delay and to reorganize the array so that it remains sorted for the ETA.

(d) Describe how this method would be implemented using the methods provided. [4]
