4.

Air pollution is a concern for public health. One measure of air pollution is the amount of
PM10 (particles measuring less than 10 micrometres) in the air. European legislation has
been put into place which requires that any town with over 100 000 inhabitants has to keep
within the following limits of PM10:
1. The average PM10 value in one day must not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic metre
(50 µg m-3) more than 35 times in the year.
2. The daily values averaged across the whole year (measured from 1 January) must not
exceed 40 micrograms per cubic metre (40 µg m-3).
In an industrial town, PM10 measurements are taken once an hour, recorded and stored.
A complete model of hourly measurements is built up over the year. At the end of the year
the town produces a report which includes the following:
• a chart of the average daily values
• the number of days the average exceeded 50 µg m-3
• the daily values averaged across the year.
(a)

Outline, using a sketch or otherwise, a method of organizing the stored data in a
spreadsheet for easy reference and analysis.

[3]

Each day the average value from the previous day is published in the local press, together
with the number of days, if any, that the daily limit (50 µg m-3) has been exceeded since
1 January.
(b)

Describe how the hourly results could be used to output the results required daily and
also to produce an end-of-year report.

[5]

The model can be used to produce data on patterns of pollution over time.
(c)
		

(i)

Identify two of these patterns.

[2]

(ii)

Explain how one of the patterns from part (c)(i) could help the town plan for
the future.

[2]

At one point in the year, the town’s daily values, averaged since 1 January, are 45 µg m-3. A
“no car” weekend is introduced, in which people are not allowed to drive their cars within the
town. It successfully reduces the average PM10 count but has a negative effect on local
commerce.
(d)

Explain how the model could be used to estimate the minimum number of “no car”
weekends that would be needed to keep the town’s daily values averaged across the
year from exceeding 40 µg m-3.

A game for very young children is played on a board, which is represented by a 4 × 4 square.
The game requires two players
The aim of the game is to be the first player to reach HOME which is the bottom right square.
The players take turns to move between squares.
Players can move to an adjacent square which, from their current position, is:
• vertically down
• horizontally to the right
• diagonally in the direction of HOME.
If one of the moves is blocked by the other player, the player can jump over the other player
and land in the square on the opposite side.
In the following diagram, player A is in square 1 and player B is in square 6.

Option D — Object-oriented programming

A small health clinic with three doctors operates in a village. All clients of the clinic have their
details stored in the clinic’s database. Patients that visit the clinic during the day are given a
priority rating (1–3) and are seated in a waiting room to wait for the next available doctor. When it
is their turn, the patients are taken from the waiting room to have a consultation with their assigned
doctor, who makes a diagnosis, provides treatment and writes a prescription.
The clinic’s system is coded in Java. There are many objects in this system and some of them are
listed below.
Object

Description

Doctor

A licensed professional who treats patients in the clinic.

Patient

A sick person who requires a consultation with a doctor.

WaitingRoom

A place where patients wait for their consultations.

Consultation

A dated meeting between a doctor and a patient which results in a
diagnosis, treatment and a prescription for medication.

Treatment

A dated record of all actions and medication prescribed to treat the
patient’s diagnosed condition.

The three objects Patient, WaitingRoom and Treatment have been defined in the following

Construct the missing lines of code in the findNextPatientIndex() method to return
the index of the first patient with the highest priority in the patients array.
Note: the highest possible priority is 3.

[3]

Construct the remove(int n) method which outputs the data of the patient object at
index n and then removes that patient object by moving all remaining patient objects
one index towards the front of the patients array.
You may assume that n is a valid index between 0 and 9, and that an instance of
Patient exists at that index.

Treatment objects are being instantiated throughout the day and added to a collection. The
object treatmentFile contains the following methods which act on that collection:

• getNext() which reads the next treatment from the collection and returns it
• hasNext() which returns false when there are no more treatments in the collection.
Construct the method showMedicationByDoctor(), which will take the name of a doctor
as a parameter and output the medication for each treatment in the collection that has been
provided by that doctor. You may assume that treatmentFile has been declared as a
global variable, that it is open for reading, and that the first time getNext() is called it will
return the first treatment from the collection.

13.

[6]

The Treatment object needs to be developed further. There are three possible types of
treatment and this is to now be recorded.
• ambulatory – the patient is treated and goes home afterwards
• in-patient – the patient spends one or more nights in the clinic
• referral – the patient is sent to a hospital in a nearby city.
All treatments have common fields such as ID of the patient, date and a doctor object, but
other fields are different. For example, ambulatory and in-patient treatments include
medication while referral does not. On the other hand, referral includes the name of
the hospital that the patient was sent to and whether or not ambulance transportation was
used. In-patient treatment includes a room number.
(a)

Construct diagrams to show how inheritance can be used to re-design the Treatment
class.

Describe three advantages of modularity in program development.
