End of Option A

Option B - Modelling and simulation
4.

The population of rare tropical insects on an island follows a geometric model such that the
population multiplies by k from one month to the next.
For example if k = 2 the population would double each month.
This situation can be expressed as either Pn+1 = kPn or Pn = P0 kn.
P0 is the initial population.
k is a constant.
Pn is the population after n months.

(a) For a value of k = 3 and an initial population of 100, calculate the population after two
months, P2.[2]

(b) With the aid of a diagram, outline the way in which a spreadsheet could be used to
estimate the size of the population after each of the first 10 months. [3]

Each month it is estimated that only 40 % of insects survive due to various circumstances
such as climate and lack of nutrition. This is known as a constant survival rate of 0.4.

(c) Outline how this factor could be built into your spreadsheet, stating any assumptions
that you make. [2]

Another model assumes a changing survival rate and recalculates the rate for each month
using the following formula:

xn+1 = r xn (1 − xn) where xn is the survival rate in month n. (0 < xn < 1)
r is a constant.

For example, using r = 3 and a survival rate of 0.4 in the first month, the survival rate for the
second month would be:

x2 = r x1 (1 − x1) = 3 × 0.4 × 0.6 = 0.72.

(d) Construct an algorithm to calculate and output survival rates for the first 10 months,
assuming that r = 3 and an initial survival rate of 0.4. [5]

The following table shows a comparison between a model with a constant survival rate of
0.4 and a model with a changing survival rate, for the first nine months.

5.

Influenza is a contagious disease and a new form is spreading throughout a city.  Some
people are affected more than others and the illness is spreading more quickly in some parts
of the city than in others. Members of the public can be given a vaccine that will prevent
them from contracting influenza.  Unfortunately, a limited amount of vaccine is available.

(a) Outline how the characteristics of the people most affected could be determined. [2]

Age, gender and current health may be factors that affect risk.

(b) Describe how a model of those most affected could be defined and applied to the
population to estimate the number of people who are at risk. [4]

(c) Outline one limitation of the model. [2]

Each day the areas in the city where people have contracted the illness are recorded.
These records can be used to simulate an estimate of the areas immediately at risk.

6.

(d) Describe the process of testing and refining the simulation. [3]

(e) Discuss how this modelling and simulation could be used to limit the spread and impact
of the illness. [4]

Bridges are modelled and these models are tested using sophisticated software before being
presented for construction.
The software enables the architect to:
• define the shape of the bridge
• apply parameters such as width, length and material to the structure
• view the bridge from different perspectives
• test the strength and stability of the bridge under all conditions.
The architect starts by defining the basic shape of the required bridge.  This includes the
span of the bridge (from one end to the other), and the struts (pillars) that are needed to
support the bridge. During this phase the architect has a wire frame image to work with.
When the design is complete, the image is rendered to give a solid view of the bridge.

(a) Outline the way in which the wire frame image can be used by the architect to adjust
the parameters and view the bridge from many different perspectives. [3]

(b) Describe how the wire frame image of the bridge is held in memory. [4]

(c) Suggest reasons for making changes on the wire frame model rather than the
solid view model. [3]

(d) Suggest a strategy to test the model and ensure that the bridge will be safe
once constructed. [4]

End of Option B

Option C - Web science
7.

A large file is being downloaded from a website using TCP/IP protocols.

(a) Outline one difference between the internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). [2]

(b) Outline the function of the transmission control protocol (TCP) in the operation
described above. [3]

The WWW is continually expanding and this has led to an upgrade in the internet
protocol (IP). The IP that uses 32 bits is being replaced by one that uses 128 bits.

(c) Outline the reasons for replacing the 32 bit protocol. [3]

The new IP uses a different format for representing the address field in the packet.

8.

(d) State the effect that this has on the domain name servers (DNS). [1]

(e) Evaluate the choice of compression software in the transfer of the file. [5]

ACAME is a company that offers a subscription service that permits the downloading of
animated cartoons.  When browsing their website the following uniform resource locator (URL)
is visited:
http://minerva.hq.acame.net/Products/index.html

(a) Identify in the given URL

(i) the domain name of the server; [1]

(ii) the file path of the resource in the server. [1]

The web page contains the following line referring to a contact person.
mailto:sly.coyote@acame.net.

(b) Outline why an expression related to mail services provides a
uniform resource identifier (URI) but not a URL. [2]

Access to part of the website is restricted and requires authentication.

(c) State two disadvantages of having the authentication based on the IP address of
the client. [2]

ACAME has developed its website to be accessible on many different devices. CSS is used
in the development of the website.

(d) With reference to this use of CSS

(i) describe one advantage for the user; [2]

(ii) describe one advantage for the web developer. [2]

The website is extremely popular. ACAME relies on a large network of servers to store and
distribute their cartoons.

(e) Discuss the implications of having distributed systems.

A user interacts with a web form in order to select the towns where there are schools with
computer science classes. The web form has two windows, one for the country, and one
for the town where a school is located. The web form is made interactive to the user so that
when selecting a country, only the appropriate towns in that country are displayed.

(a) Describe how this interaction can be generated dynamically. [3]

By making the selection through the web form, the individual websites of the selected
schools, including other resources and services, may be accessed.

(b) Outline the role of open standards in providing web-based services. [4]

Schools manage their own website and resources, and the school website must be
easily retrieved.

(c) Explain one example of the use of a white hat technique to optimize the search process.  [3]

(d) Discuss, with an example, how a Creative Commons license could be used in
this situation. [6]

End of Option C

Option D - Object-oriented programming
In a particular country the Department of Transport analyses all of the train journeys of the different train
companies in order to determine their reliability.
A team of programmers have created an OOP system for the Department of Transport to use.
The TrainCompany class is partially shown below.
public class TrainCompany
{
private String companyName;
private String companyCode;
private int numberOfJourneys;
private Journey[] journeyHistory = new Journey[100000];
public TrainCompany(String x, String y)
{
this.companyName = x;
this.companyCode = y;
this.numberOfJourneys = 0;
}
public TrainCompany(){}
// accessor and mutator methods
Journey getJourney(int x)
{
return journeyHistory[x];
}
public void addJourney(Journey j)
{
journeyHistory[numberOfJourneys] = j;
numberOfJourneys++;
}
public double averageDelay()
{code missing}
// returns the average delay for all of a company’s journeys
public String longestDelay(Codes[] c)
{code missing}
// returns the route name for the journey with the longest delay

}

public String toString(Codes[] c)
{code missing}

10.

11.

(a) By making reference to OOP features, outline why it is possible for the TrainCompany
class to have two constructors.

(b) Outline the consequence of having the accessor and mutator methods declared
as protected.[2] [3]

Every time a train journey is completed a Journey object is created. The Journey class is
partially shown below.
public class Journey
{
private … routeCode;
// A unique identifier for a particular route
private … delay;
// Minutes late in arriving at the destination
private … weatherRelated;
// Equals true if the journey is affected by the weather,
// otherwise false.
// Constructor which initializes all 3 of the above data items
// accessor and mutator methods.
}

(a) State the most appropriate data type for each of the three data items in the
Journey class. [2]

(b) Construct the constructor method for the Journey class. [3]

The following code updates the journey information for each train company. This includes
the creation of the data structure allCompanies, which is an array of TrainCompany.
TrainCompany[] allCompanies = new TrainCompany[3];
allCompanies[0] = new TrainCompany(“Southern”,”T290”);
allCompanies[1] = new TrainCompany(“Northern”,”T400”);
allCompanies[2] = new TrainCompany(“Eastern”,”T155”);
Journey s = new Journey(“J100”,3, false);
Journey t = new Journey(“J103”,8, true);
Journey u = new Journey(“J104”,10, true);
allCompanies[0].addJourney(s);
allCompanies[1].addJourney(t);
allCompanies[0].addJourney(u);
allCompanies[0].addJourney(new Journey(“J101”,6, false));
System.out.println(allCompanies[0].getCompanyCode());
System.out.println(allCompanies[0].getJourney(1).getDelay());
System.out.println(allCompanies[1].getNumberOfJourneys());

(c) State the output after the above code is executed. [3]

12.

The Department of Transport requires data from each company regarding the average length
of delays. Delays that are caused by the weather are not included.
The averageDelay() method in the TrainCompany class returns the average delay for all
of the journeys. The method does not count delays caused by weather.

13.

(a) State the value returned by the method call allCompanies[0].averageDelay();,
assuming that the code in question 11 has been executed. [1]

(b) Construct the method averageDelay(). You can assume that each TrainCompany
object has at least one journey. [6]

A further class, Codes, links each routeCode to the routeName, which contains the
departure and destination stations, as shown below.
public class Codes
{
private String routeName; // e.g. New Amsterdam - Diamond City
private String routeCode;
public Codes(String a, String b)
{
this.routeName = a;
this.routeCode = b;
}
public String getRouteCode()
{
return routeCode;
}

}

(a) public String getRouteName()
{
return routeName;
}

Construct the UML diagram for the Codes class. [3]

The array allCodes[] is an unordered array of Codes objects. It contains the details
of every route for all of the train companies. The method longestDelay()in the
TrainCompany class returns the route name for the journey with the longest delay not
caused by the weather.

(b) Construct the method longestDelay(). You can assume that all route codes are
present in allCodes[].[7]

14.

The Department of Transport wants to expand this program to include similar analysis for bus
and airplane journeys.

(a) Describe how inheritance could be used to provide an organized set of classes for all of
these forms of transport.

(b) (i)

(ii) [4]

Draw a diagram showing the dependencies between all of the classes described
so far, including any introduced in part (a). You can assume that the Journey
and Codes classes remain unchanged. [4]

Outline the reasons for keeping dependencies to a minimum. You should include
an example using the classes described so far. [3]

The output from one call to the toString() method in the TrainCompany class is shown below.
Eastern : Average Delay = 2.5 minutes : Longest Delay = Newtown - Westlock Bay

(c) Construct the toString() method. You should make use of previously
defined methods. [4]
