(a) (b)

(c) The two constructors have different parameter sets (or equivalent);
Compiler can differentiate between the two;
The compiler will execute the constructor whose parameter set matches the
arguments in the constructor call ;
This is an example of polymorphism/overloading; [3]

Access is restricted to;
(methods that are part of) the same package / project; [2]

Award [2] for all 3 correct and [1] for any 2 correct.
routeCode is String
delay is int (Note: Allow any numeric)
weatherRelated is Boolean [2]

“public Journey”;
Correct parameters (Note: Allow FT from part (a));
Correct assignment statements;
Note: Allow any order. Allow absence of “this”.
public Journey(String a, int b, Boolean c)
{
this.routeCode = a;
this.delay = b;
this.weatherRelated = c;
} [3]

12.

(a) 4.5; [1]

(b) Award marks as follows:
Initializing variables used (e.g.total as a double and count as an integer);
Correct loop;
Correct comparison* (allow getJourney[x]);
Updating total*;
Updating count (in correct position);
Returning average;
Note: *If “get” methods are not used but otherwise correct, award [1] for these
two points.
public double averageDelay()
{
int delayTotal = 0; // Allow total as a double with no
// casting below
int count = 0;
for (int x=0; x<numberOfJourneys; x++)
{
if (!journeyHistory[x].getWeatherRelated())
{
delayTotal = delayTotal +
journeyHistory[x].getDelay();
count++;
}
}
return double(delayTotal)/count;
}

(a) [6]

Award [1] for each section (award [2] if correct except for +/-).
Allow for slight variations of syntax.
Allow if constructer missing.
Allow public class Codes.
Codes
- routeName : String
- routeCode : String
+Codes(a: String, b: String)
+getRouteName() : String
+getRouteCode() : String [3]

Award marks as follows:
Initialization of maxDelay to be a rogue value or 0, or 1st value;
Award {2 marks] for correct comparison (award 1 mark if weather related
ignored);
Updating of maxDelay;
Updating of maxCode;
Both loops correct;
Searching for route code;
Return route name;
public String longestDelay(Codes [] c)
{
String route = " ";
String maxCode =" ";
int maxDelay =-1;
for (int x = 0; x < numberOfJourneys; x++)
{
if ((journeyHistory[x].getDelay() > maxDelay) &&
(!journeyHistory[x].getWeatherRelated()))
{
maxDelay = journeyHistory[x].getDelay();
maxCode = journeyHistory[x].getRouteCode();
}
}
for (int y=0; y<c.length; y++)
{
if (c[y] != null)
{
if (c[y].getRouteCode() == maxCode)
{
route = c[y].getRouteName();
}
}
}
return route;
} [7]

(a) (b)

A super-class could be created (eg Transport);
With sub-classes Bus, Train and Plane;
Containing variables/methods common to all the different transport
classes/examples;
The individual sub-classes can inherit these common attributes;
Whilst having properties particular to themselves/ can override;

(i) [4]

Award [1] for a diagram showing five (or more) classes linked in some way.
Award [1] for each of the three different dependencies shown, either with the
correctly shaped arrow or with a written description, up to [3 max].
The dependencies are:
Each of the train company, bus and airplane classes “is a” Transport class;
The train company class “has a” Journey;
The train company class “uses” the Codes class;

Bus
Transport

(superclass) is a
Plane
Train
uses
Codes

has a
Journey [4]

(ii) Changes in one class in a dependency will/may affect the other class(es) in
this dependency;
This may cause programs using the second class not to function
(correctly)/require modifications to the second class to avoid problems;
For example, if the variables in the Codes class changed type then the
TrainCompany etc methods would have to be changed;
(Less dependencies lead to) reduced maintenance overheads;
As a programmer editing one class would not have to be concerned with
other classes / allows programmers to focus just on the class they are
writing; [3]

public String toString(Codes [] c)
{
String d = companyName;
double e = averageDelay();
String f = longestDelay(c);
String result = d + " : Average Delay = " + e + " :
Longest Delay = " + f;
return result;
}

Note: Can be written in one line. Students may introduce validation on e.
Award marks as follows:
Extracting company name;
Correct use of averageDelay() method;
Correct use of longestDelay() method;
Correct result line either returned or output;
(Note: Ignore minor punctuation errors/missing parameter); [4]
