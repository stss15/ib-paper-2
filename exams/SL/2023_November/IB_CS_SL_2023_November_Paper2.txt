Option D - Object-oriented programming

A company that manufactures a children’s card game, Monster Battle, wants to create a
software version. Figure 7 shows three sample cards from the game.

Each monster begins the game with a number of health points, which are stated on the card,
and leaves the game when it has no remaining health points. During a battle between two
monsters, players take turns to roll the dice. The results determine how much each monster’s
attack will reduce the defending monster’s health points.
Some initial classes have been created to model this scenario.
public class Monster {
public static final int ICE_MONSTER_TYPE = 1;
public static final int WATER_MONSTER_TYPE = 2;
public static final int FIRE_MONSTER_TYPE = 3;
public String name = "Unknown";
public int health = 100;
public int strength = 10;
public int monsterType = 0;
public Monster(String name, int health, int monsterType) {
this.name = name;
this.health = health;
this.monsterType = monsterType;
}
public void attack(Monster defender) {
//to be written
}

private static int rollDice() {
//returns a random integer between 1 and 12
return new java.util.Random().nextInt(12)+1;
}
public static void output(String message) {
System.out.println(message);
}

}
public class WaterMonster extends Monster {
public WaterMonster(String name, int health) {
super(name,health, Monster.WATER_MONSTER_TYPE);
}
}
public class FireMonster extends Monster {
public FireMonster(String name, int health){
super(name, health, Monster.FIRE_MONSTER_TYPE);
}
}

10.

(a) Define the term static as used in the declaration ICE_MONSTER_TYPE in the
Monster class. [1]

(b) (i)	Outline one advantage of making all instance variables in the Monster
class private. [2]

Some instance variables may need to be retrieved and changed from outside the
class even though they will be declared private.

(ii) (c)

State two types of method that would allow this to happen. [2]

Outline why the keyword super is used in the constructor of the WaterMonster class. [2]

The finished game may include some open source software.

(d) Identify two aims of the open source movement. [2]

(e) Construct code that creates an instance of a fire-type monster called Flamey with
40 health points. [2]

The Monster class contains the method attack(Monster defender). This is used when
a monster attacks another monster (the defender).
This method:
y decreases the health variable of the defending monster by the amount returned by the
rollDice method
y uses the output method to display a defending monster’s name, damage and health
points if its health variable is greater than zero
y sets the defending monster’s health variable to zero if it is less than zero
y outputs the defending monster’s name followed by “must leave the game” if its health
variable is zero.

11.

(a) Construct the method attack(Monster defender), using any existing static
methods in the Monster class that might be useful.

(b) Outline two differences between the FireMonster class and an instance of
FireMonster.[4]

The programmer has created a class named Arena to model the place in which the
monsters will battle.
public class Arena {
public Monster[] monsters = new Monster[10];
int monsterCount = 0; //the number of monsters currently
in array
public void addMonster(Monster M) {
// to be written
}
public void removeMonster(Monster M) {
//to be written
}
public void doOneOnOneBattle(Monster A, Monster B) {
while (A.health > 0 && B.health > 0) {
gameLog(A.attack(B));
gameLog(B.attack(A));
}
if (A.health > B.health) {
output(A.name + " WINS!");
removeMonster(B);
} else if (B.health > A.health) {
output(B.name + " WINS!");
removeMonster(A);
} else {
output("IT IS A DRAW!");
}
}
public static void output(String message) {
System.out.println(message);
}
} [4]

(c) Construct a simple UML class diagram showing the relationships between FireMonster,
Monster and Arena. You do not need to include variables and methods. [2]

The method addMonster(Monster M) does the following:
y If the monster array is not full and M is not in the array, it adds M to the array and
increases the variable monsterCount.
y Otherwise, a message is output stating the reason why.

(d) Construct the method addMonster(Monster M).[5]

(e) Outline two disadvantages of using object-oriented programming (OOP) in the
development of software. [4]

12.

(a)	Define the term polymorphism.[2]
The method removeMonster(Monster M) in the Arena class removes Monster M from
the array without leaving any gaps. It also updates the monsterCount variable. You may
assume that Monster M already exists in the Arena.

(b) Construct the method removeMonster(Monster M)[6]

Monsters have three special abilities that may be used on other monsters:
y The ability “Heal”, which can be used on another monster
y An ability specific to the monster type (eg, all water-type monsters have the ability
“Put out fire”)
y An ability specific to the monster (eg, only instances of Squishy have the ability “Clean”).
The methods ability1(Monster defender), ability2(Monster defender) and
ability3(Monster defender) will be created to enable the monsters to perform their
abilities. A class for each individual monster card, eg “Squishy”, will be created.

(c) (i)	Define the term inheritance.[2]

(ii) Explain how inheritance and polymorphism could be used to maximize code
reuse in these three methods. [5]
