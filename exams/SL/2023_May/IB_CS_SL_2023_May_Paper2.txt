Option D — Object-oriented programming
10.

A real estate business maintains an unsorted database of houses and apartments that it tries
to sell for the property owners.
The following UML diagram describes the objects in the current system.

- name: String

(a)

Define the term primitive data type.[1]

Boolean[1]

(ii)

integer.[1]

State the relationship between
(i)

Owner and Property[1]

House and Property.[1]

(d)

Distinguish between a class and an instantiation in this scenario.

[2]

(e)

Outline how the modifier static affects how a variable is used.

[2]

(f)

Describe how the modifier static could be used to access the total number of both
House and Apartment objects that have been created in this system.

The object-oriented software solution that implements this system for the real estate business
allows a customer to select a maximum of 10 houses that he or she is interested in. These
houses are stored in an array wishList of type House.
(g)

Construct the code needed to instantiate an array wishList that can store a maximum
of 10 House objects.

(a)	Define the term encapsulation.[1]
(b)

Explain one benefit provided by encapsulation.[3]

The real estate business is planning to expand its database to include student housing.
These “houses” are usually single rooms in a privately owned house.
(c)

Explain one benefit of using inheritance to create a new class Room.[3]

Many of the prospective students have an international background.
(d)

Explain one feature of modern programming languages that allows for internationalization. [3]

12.

All the unsorted House objects in the database have been copied to a sufficiently large array
allHouses. This array is not completely filled with House objects.
The array allHouses and all methods in this question are declared in the main program class.
All methods can access the array allHouses directly.
Consider the following method.
public void unknown(String x)
{
  for (int i=0; i<allHouses.length; i++)
  {
    if (allHouses[i].getCity().equals(x))
    { 	
      System.out.println (allHouses[i].getAddress());
    }
  }
}

(a)

Define the term method signature.[2]

(b)

Describe how the original String variable, passed to a method as a parameter,
can be assigned a new value by that method.

(c)

State the intended purpose of the method unknown.[1]

(d)

(i)	Outline the runtime error that is likely to occur if this method is called.

[2]

(ii)

[2]

(e)

Outline how this error can be corrected.

[2]

Construct the code for the method houseSort that will sort the array allHouses in
ascending order of price.[5]

A method is needed to select from the original unsorted array allHouses the three most
expensive houses below or equal to a given price.
(f)

Construct the code for the method selectThree that will take an integer parameter
budget. It must return a sorted array of size 3 that contains the three most expensive
House objects (in ascending order of price) with a price that is less than or equal
to budget.
You may assume that the array allHouses contains at least three House objects
with a price less than or equal to budget. As part of your answer you should use the
method houseSort() as developed in part (e).
