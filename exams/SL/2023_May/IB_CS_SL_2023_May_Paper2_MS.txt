Option D - Object oriented programming (OOP)
10.

(a) Award [1 max].
These are data types that are pre-defined / fundamental / basic in the programming
language;
A data type that is always assigned a value (in the memory);
They are the building blocks of the composite data types / classes / objects;
The types that are implemented directly as bit patterns (by a Java compiler);

(b) (i)

Award [1 max] for any suitable example. Allow a description.
For example
hasParking;
hasPool;
hasGarden;
Whether the property has been sold or not;

(ii) Award [1 max] for any suitable example. Allow a description.
For example
numberRooms;
area;
The number of bathrooms;

(c) (i)

(ii) Award [1 max].
Aggregation (allow Property 'has a' Owner);

Award [1 max].
Inheritance (allow House 'is a' Property);
House is a subclass of Property;
House inherits Property;

(d) Award [2 max].
Award [1] for distinguishing between a class and an instantiation at the definition level;
Award [1] for including an example;
A class (e.g. House class) is a blueprint / definition / specification (that defines all variables
and methods that are needed) and an instantiation of a class is creates a (new) object of that
class [1] (e.g. a (new) object of an actual house giving its actual address etc [1];

(e) Award [2 max].
A static variable is used when it is to be a class variable (belongs to the class not to the
instantiation);
It is used when all objects of that class are to have the same value for the static variable;
It will not be instantiated when a new object is created;
If the value of a static variable is changed, it will be changed in all instances of that class;
It does not require an object of that class to be accessed;

(f) Award [2 max].
Both classes House and Apartment need a static (integer) variable count;
that is incremented whenever a new object of that class is created;
A static variable (e.g total) could be defined in the Property class;
Which is incremented every time a House or Apartment object is instantiated;
A static method in the Property class retrieves the total number of house and apartments;
From static total variables that are in each of the 2 sub-classes;

(g) Award [3 max].
Award [1] for the identifier (left-hand side);
Award [1] for use of new;
Award [1] for House[10];
House[] wishList = new House[10];

11.

(a) Award [1 max].
The grouping of the data and the methods that operate on the data into one single unit;
The practice of hiding the structure and representation of data within a class with the use of
private variables / and making it only accessible outside that class via accessor functions;
The practice of hiding the structure and representation of data within a class and making
it only accessible directly from within that class;

(b) Award [3 max].
Improved security;
Using data-hiding / Use of private variables;
So that other classes cannot (accidentally) access/change the data (directly) / So other
classes have to use accessor methods to access the data / So programs can be made readonly;
Ease of maintenance / reusability;
Programs will be easier to update / reuse;
Because changes to the encapsulated class should not impact on other classes / Because all
data and methods are in the same place;
Ease of understanding;
Programs will be easier to follow;
Because all data and methods are in the same place;
Ease of testing;
Because the class can be fully tested in isolation;
And limited code will contain fewer mistakes than the full program;
Faster development (of whole program);
Different classes can be worked on by teams;
Each class is effectively independent of others;

(c) Award [3 max].
Inheritance reduces the amount of coding in the sub-class / reduces repetition of code;
By allowing sub-classes to inherit the methods / attributes of their superclass;
Therefore, leading to time being saved in the development of code;
Inheritance reduces maintenance overhead;
Because modifications to the super class are automatically inherited by the subclasses;
Reduces the errors when writing code;
Inheritance allows for further expansion / simplifies future development;
As other subclasses can inherit from the classes already present;
Or add additional functionality specific to the sub-class;
Note: only award marks from one cluster (do not mix and match the marking points from
different clusters).

(d) Award [3 max].
Modern programming languages use Unicode;
Which can encode 216 (about 64,000) characters;
Compared to ASCII which only uses 8 bits;
Which includes special characters from different alphabets/languages/character sets;
Allowing these programming languages to be used by people from different parts of the world
(only award this marking point if a correct reason has already been given);

12.

(a) Award [2 max].
The signature defines the parameters (and their types);
The method name / identifier;
Allow either the return type or access modifier for a mark;

(b) Award [2 max].
String is an immutable object / Java uses pass-by-value / does not use pass-byreference;
It cannot simply have its value reassigned inside the method;
The method type must be String;
To return the new value for that String variable;

(c) Award [1 max].
To output the addresses of all houses in a given city;
Note to examiners. Must imply all the houses that match, not just one.

(d) (i)

Award [2 max]
The length of the array may not correspond to the number of houses stored;
Causing a null pointer error/exception;
Since the loop may try to access the getCity method for a null entry;

(ii) Award [2 max.]
Declare a variable count that stores the number of objects in allHouses;
Change loop condition to j<count;
Add a test if(allHouses[i]!=null);
Before testing allHouses[i].getCity().equals(x) ;
Use a while loop with a double condition;
(i<allHouses.length)&&(allHouses[i]!=null) ;
Initially fill the array with dummy objects;
So that no null entries will be encountered;
Change the array to an arrayList;
So that no null entries will be encountered / so that the array has the exact
number of valid objects in it;

(e) Award [5 max].
Award [1] for correctly declaring a swap variable;
Award [1] for correct outer loop;
Award [1] for correct inner loop;
Award [1] for correctly testing prices (allow .price);
Award [1] for correct swap statements (ignore here any incorrect declaration of swap
variable);
Notes to examiners.
• As there are many variations on sort routines you will need to carefully read
through each response. You can ignore minor syntax errors in every algorithm
answer.
• Note that is the House objects that are being swapped, not the prices. However, if
prices are being swapped, allow FT for ta swap variable declared as a numeric
type.
