Option D - Object-oriented programming

A car rental company has offices in cities in Spain and Portugal. It manages its cars as
a large, unsorted collection of rental objects that is accessed by a Java program.
The following UML diagram describes the current main Rental class. Fuel type and
transmission type were chosen to be Boolean because they have two choices: petrol
or diesel for fuel type, and manual or automatic for transmission type.
The brand and the model of the car are stored together as one string brandModel.
Typically the company has many cars of the same brand and model.

+ default constructor
+ accessor and mutator methods

10.

(a) Outline the general nature of an object. [2]

(b) State one mutator method to be included in the class Rental.[1]

(c) Construct the code for the accessor method getBrandModel().[3]

(d) Outline one purpose of a default constructor. [2]

The company is buying new electric cars and hybrid cars.

(e) Outline one change that needs to be made to class Rental due to this development. [2]

Based on this Rental class, the program defines several other classes: Car, Bus and
Van, each with their own characteristics. For example, the class Car adds the attribute
numberOfDoors to the class Rental.

(f) State the relationship between Rental and Car.[1]

(g) Construct the code for the class Car without having to duplicate all the attributes and
methods from the class Rental. The default constructor of the class Rental should
be overridden to also assign the value 4 to numberOfDoors. No other constructors
are required. [3]

11.

(a)	Identify the OOP feature that was used to declare the Car class. [1]

(b) Explain the benefits of the feature identified in part (a).[3]

(c) Identify the two other features of OOP. [2]

(d) Describe one advantage of modularity in program development. [2]

All Car objects have been read into a large unsorted array called allCars.
A method is needed to show customers the range of available cars.
This method should take the array allCars as a parameter and select Car objects from
allCars so that every available brandModel is presented only once.
You may assume that there are never more than 100 different types of cars (as identified by
the variable brandModel).

12.

(a) Define the term parameter variable.[2]

(b) Construct the code for the method findBrandModels() that will take the array
allCars as a parameter. It must return a Car array that contains every brandModel
that is available without duplication. [8]

A customer wants to see which different types of cars are available. The criteria are it must
be a petrol car with automatic transmission and cost less than 35 euros per day.

(c)

Without writing code, outline the steps needed for a method to perform this query and
present the results to the customer. [5]

The car rental company also has a database of customers. For each customer it stores an
object with personal data such as their ID, name and address.
This Customer object includes the history of the cars they have rented and the car they are
currently renting (if any).

13.

(a) Draw the relationship between Customer and Car objects. [1]

A suggestion has been made to modify the Rental class to include customerID.
The intention is to make it easier to find the customer who has a certain car.

(b) Describe in terms of dependencies why this suggestion is inappropriate. [2]

(c) Explain the ethical obligations for programmers when developing a customer database. [5]
